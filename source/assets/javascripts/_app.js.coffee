# Hey, if you don't like coffeescript, just rename this file to app.js
# But you should really give coffeescript a go. You might also wanna check
# out http://js2.coffee/ if you need to convert some javascript to coffeescript.

# Other code goes below

# Initialise Foundation
$(document).foundation()

# WOW plugin to trigger animations on viewport entry
new WOW().init()

console.log 'app.js loaded'
